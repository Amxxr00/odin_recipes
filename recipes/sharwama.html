  <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
  <p>
    A shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish known for its flavorful and
    savory qualities.
  </p>
  <h1>INGREDIENTS AND PREPARATION</h1>
  <p>
    Shawarma begins with marinated meat, traditionally either chicken, lamb,
    beef, or a combination thereof. The meat is thinly sliced and stacked in a
    cone-like shape on a vertical rotisserie. The marinade typically includes a
    mix of spices such as cumin, paprika, turmeric, garlic, and sometimes yogurt
    or lemon juice to tenderize and flavor the meat.
  </p>
  <h1>COOKING PROCESS</h1>
  <p>
    As the rotisserie turns, the outer layer of the meat slowly cooks and crisps
    up. This slow cooking process allows the meat to retain its juices and
    flavors while developing a delicious charred exterior.

  <h1>SERVING</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Flatbread: The most common type of flatbread used is pita bread or a
      similar Middle Eastern flatbread like laffa or taboon. The bread is often
      warmed or lightly toasted before assembling the shawarma.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meat: Thin slices of roasted meat (chicken, beef, lamb, or a combination)
      are placed inside the flatbread. The meat is usually juicy and flavorful
      from the marinade and slow-roasting process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Vegetables: Fresh vegetables are added for crunch and freshness. Common
      choices include shredded lettuce, slices of tomatoes, cucumbers, and
      onions. Sometimes pickles or pickled vegetables are also included.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sauces: Shawarma is often topped with a variety of sauces or spreads,
      which can vary depending on regional preferences. Popular choices include
      tahini (sesame seed paste) sauce, garlic sauce, hummus, yogurt-based
      sauces, or spicy sauces like harissa.
    </li>
    <li>
      Additional Flavors: Some variations might include additional ingredients
      such as pickled turnips, sumac, parsley, or even French fries inside the
      wrap for added texture.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wrapping: Once the ingredients are placed inside the flatbread, it is
      wrapped or rolled tightly into a cone or cylinder shape, often wrapped in
      wax paper or foil to hold it together and make it easier to eat.
