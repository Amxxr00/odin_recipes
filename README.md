In this project, I will be collecting, organizing, and presenting a variety of recipes from around the world. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to research, categorize, and communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner. I will also showcase my skills in data analysis, recipe scaling, and nutritional information calculation. Additionally, I will demonstrate my creativity and design skills by presenting the recipes in a visually appealing and easy-to-follow format. Upon completion, I will have a comprehensive recipe collection that showcases my organizational, technical, and creative abilities. # odin_recipes
